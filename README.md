# Grid Overlay

This is a small JavaScript component for adding a grid overlay to the page.

## Installation

Copy the files from the `build/` folder and add them to the `<head>` section:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/grid-overlay.css">
<script type="module" src="/path/to/grid-overlay.js"></script>
```

Or, if you've got your own build system, you can take the files from the `src/`
folder instead and include them any which way you're used to.
